# VIR

***

**VIR** is an intelligent time-management tool designed to tame the stress. By
simply listing your tasks and schedules, VIR can automatically generate plans
around your available time, and alert you of potential conflicts, so you'll
never have to worry about unrealistic deadlines or todo-list overload.
